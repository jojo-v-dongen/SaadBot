# SaadBot
Simple discord bot made in python for me and my friends to use.

# Decription
SaadBot offers a diverse range of entertainment and utility commands, catering to a variety of interests and preferences. With its Fun Commands, users can engage in light-hearted interactions such as hugging, cuddling, and even injecting some humor with the $Gay and $Insult commands. Additionally, SaadBot brings an element of unpredictability with the $Pog command, adding an element of surprise to conversations as it was an inside joke. For those looking to streamline their Discord experience, the bot provides practical functionalities like privately sending a message with $Send and message purging with $Clear. While it maintains a light-hearted atmosphere, SaadBot also caters to movie enthusiasts, with the exclusive $Movie command for announcements (A command specially made for my friend whom always did the movie announcements). Furthermore the bot offers some questionable commands like sharing links for illegal movie and game downloads. Overall, SaadBot was a great success and a great bot for me and my friends, it made things automated and easier such as movie announcements and was simply very fun to work with.
